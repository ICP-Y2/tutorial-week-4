# Tutorial-week-4

**For this tutorial**, 
`Simulate the following system with the specified resources as per the given circuit diagram and the source code in TinkerCad.`,
you will be working with the following simulation and make some observations in the simulation. So, your task is to provide answers to `What are the observations you have made in the simulation?` and `What is your conclusion from the observations made in the simulation?`

## 1.	Simulate the discrete Input/Sensor and Output/Actuator
> Resources Required
-	Arduino UNO
-	LED
-	Button
-	Resistors `330 ohm` for Led and `1 Kohm` for button

> ### Steps
> - Find the required components from the resources tab in tinker cad (right of the screen)
> - Connect the anode to ``digital pin number 8`` and cathode to ground `GND` of led in the arduino. Make sure to use the resistor in led (Cathode terminal).

## 2.	Simulate Ultrasonic Sensor with Arduino
> Resources Required
-	Arduino UNO
-	LED
-	Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
-	Resistors `220 ohm`
-	M-M Jumper Wires
